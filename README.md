# Hi, I'm Sameep 👋

I'm a Computer Science graduate (B.Tech CSE) interested in:

- Deep learning and computer vision  
- Medical imaging (MRI, brain tumors)  
- AI for healthcare

## What I’ve worked on

- 🧠 **Brain Tumor Detection (MRI)**  
  - Used EfficientNet and Grad-CAM on MRI images to detect brain tumors.  
  - Focus on lightweight models that can still give good accuracy.

- 🩻 **MRI Image Enhancement with ESRGAN**  
  - Used ESRGAN to improve MRI image quality for better tumor detection.

- 🔐 **Security & Anomaly Detection Projects**  
  - Cyber threat detection with machine learning.  
  - Credit card fraud detection using Random Forest, XGBoost, SMOTE.

## Skills

- **Languages:** Python  
- **ML / DL:** PyTorch / TensorFlow (whichever you use), scikit-learn, OpenCV  
- **Topics:** CNNs, transfer learning, image classification, GANs, medical imaging  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

## Projects

Here are some of my public repos:

- [cyber-threat-detection](https://github.com/Teepsq/cyber-threat-detection)  
- [-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-Random-Forest-XGBoost-SMOTE](https://github.com/Teepsq/-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-Random-Forest-XGBoost-SMOTE)  
- *(I will add my medical imaging projects here once I push the code.)*
